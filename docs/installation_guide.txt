<<< Open PTrack >>>

Installation guide for Open PTrack on Ubuntu 13.04 (64bit, desktop version).
(Please note that <open_ptrack_main_folder> means the folder containing 'docs', 'detection', and other folders.)

1) For cloning Open PTrack repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/OpenPTrack/open_ptrack.git

2) ROS Hydro installation (from a terminal):
cd <open_ptrack_main_folder>/docs
chmod +x ros_install.sh
./ros_install.sh

(Answer yes to all questions)

3) ROS Hydro configuration:
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
chmod +x ros_configure.sh
./ros_configure.sh

4) Open PTrack compilation:
cp -R <open_ptrack_main_folder> ~/workspace/ros/catkin/src/open_ptrack
(or you can clone the open_ptrack repository as explained in (1) directly into '~/workspace/ros/catkin/src')
cd ~/workspace/ros/catkin
catkin_make --pkg opt_msgs
catkin_make --force-cmake


--- People detection test ---
Connect a Microsoft Kinect for XBOX360 and run:
roslaunch detection detector_depth.launch

When the point cloud appears, press Shift+LeftClick on 3 (non collinear) points of the ground plane. Then, press 'Q'. 
You should see the RGB image with people detections surrounded by white rectangles.


--- People tracking test ---
Connect a Microsoft Kinect for XBOX360 and run:
roslaunch tracking detection_and_tracking.launch

When the point cloud appears, press Shift+LeftClick on 3 (non collinear) points of the ground plane. Then, press 'Q'. 
You should see an RGB image with people detections surrounded by white rectangles and ROS visualizer showing a top view of people centroids.

For listening to tracking output messages, two options are available:
a) for reading tracking messages in YAML format:
rostopic echo /tracker/tracks
b) for reading tracking JSON-formatted messages sent via UDP:
roslaunch opt_utils udp_listener.launch
For this last option, UDP and JSON parameters can be set in '<open_ptrack_main_folder>/opt_utils/conf/json_udp.yaml'.

For stopping execution, press 'Ctrl'+'C' or kill the people detection process as follows:
killall -9 ground_based_people_detector
